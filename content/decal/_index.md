# About

This course is designed to be a survey of useful algorithms and their applications in competitive programming and coding interviews. Before taking this course, you should have a basic understanding of programming (61A or equivalent) and preferrably some experience with either Python or C++.

This course has some concepts in common with 61B, 70, and 170, but there is a bigger emphasis on implementation and application.

### Location

Monday 6:30-8 PM @ Physics Building 2

### Book

[CSES Handbook](cses.fi/book.pdf)

# Policy

## Coursework

The class is composed of two components, the lecture between 6:30-8 PM on Mondays introducing concepts and a corresponding weekly assignment due at Sunday midnight. We expect the homework to take around one hour of work. Some homeworks may have optional challenge problems. Remote office hours will be available on discord for which we will post schedules for after lecture.

## Grading

| Category   | Percent | Criteria                           |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Homework   | 70%     | Demonstrated effort, participation |
| Attendance | 30%     | Form with password at each lecture |

You receive a P in this class if you receive 70% or higher aggregate score. Late work will get 50% credit. The class shouldn't be stressful! If you have extenuating circumstances or find yourself falling behind, please reach out to us.

## Collaboration

Study groups are allowed and encouraged. Sharing ideas is fine, but sharing code is not allowed.

## About

This course is designed to be a survey of useful algorithms and their applications in competitive programming and coding interviews. Before taking this course, you should have a basic understanding of programming (61A or equivalent) and preferrably some experience with either Python or C++.

This course has some concepts in common with 61B, 70, and 170, but there is a bigger emphasis on implementation and application.

## Location

Monday 6:30-8 PM @ Physics Building 2 (Room TBD)

## Policy (Tentative)

The class is composed of two components, the lecture between 6:30-8 PM on Mondays introducing concepts and a corresponding weekly assignment due at Sunday midnight. We expect the homework to take around one hour of work. Some homeworks may have optional challenge problems. Remote office hours will be available on discord for which we will post schedules for after lecture.

You receive a P in this class if you complete 70% or more of the assignments on time. Late work will get 50% credit. The class shouldn't be stressful! If you have extenuating circumstances or find yourself falling behind, please reach out to us.

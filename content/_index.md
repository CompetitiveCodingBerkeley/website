# About us

**Our proposition is simple -- solve problems and have fun.** We originally gathered around the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), but now also host [lockout tournaments](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/72557) with other schools, do [codeforces contests](https://codeforces.com), and teach the [Competitive Programming DeCal](decal).

If you're looking to participate in ICPC, we have unfortunately concluded team selection contests. However, we may still be able to work something out. If you're interested, drop by our discord and DM the officers.
